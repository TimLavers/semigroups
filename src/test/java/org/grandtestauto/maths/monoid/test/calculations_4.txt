C4 = { 1 2 3 4, 2 3 4 1, 3 4 1 2, 4 1 2 3 }

2 1 3 4 = 2 1 3 4 * 1 2 3 4
1 3 2 4 = 1 3 2 4 * 1 2 3 4
1 2 4 3 = 2 3 1 4 * 4 1 2 3
4 2 3 1 = 1 3 2 4 * 2 3 4 1
1 4 3 2 = 3 2 1 4 * 3 4 1 2

In the following, a, b, c, d are distinct elements of {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Consider a b c d.

This permutation takes d to 4. It can be written as a product theta * gamma^k,
where theta(4) = 4 and gamma = 2 3 4 1. In this case, k = d.

So a b c d = x y z 4 * gamma^d.

So x y z 4 = a b c d * gamma^(4 - d).

Consider (alpha, gamma^x) * (beta, gamma*y)

This is the same as (alpha * gamma^x) * (beta * gamma^y)
Which is alpha * (gamma^x * beta) * gamma^y

Now beta fixes 4: beta(4) = 4.

So gamma^x * beta takes x to 4.

gamma^x * beta = gamma^x * beta * gamma^(4 - x) * gamma^x
